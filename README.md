# Mastermind Game Frontend

This is the **frontend** for the Mastermind game, built with **React** and **Vite**. It communicates with the Mastermind backend via RESTful API endpoints.

---

## Features

- Start a new game with customizable difficulty (`Easy`, `Normal`, `Hard`)  
- Input guesses and receive feedback on each attempt  
- Receive hints for the secret code  
- Track attempt history in real-time  
- Display leaderboard for top players per difficulty  
- Fully interactive and responsive UI  

---

## Tech Stack

- React (functional components, hooks)  
- Vite (development build tool)  
- Fetch API for HTTP requests  
- CSS for styling  

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+  
- npm 8+  
- Running instance of Mastermind backend

### Installation

1. Clone the frontend repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alpogi2dmax/mastermind-frontend
cd mastermind-frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

---

## Environment Variables

- .env -- local development backend URL:

```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

- .env.production -- points to the deployed backend:

```
VITE_API_URL=https://mastermind-cqjz.onrender.com
```

The frontend will automatically use .env.production when you run a production build(npm run build). You can update VITE_API_URL in either file to switch backends.

---

## Running the Development Server

Start the frontend in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

---

## Building for Production

Generate a production-ready build:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Usage

1. Open the app in your browser.
2. Enter a player name and select a difficulty.
3. Start a new game:
    - Secret code is generated by the backend.
    - Input guesses and submit to receive feedback.
    - Use hints if needed.
4. When the game finishes, the leaderboard updates automatically.

## API Integration

The frontend communicates with the backend at these enpoints.

| Endpoint              | Method        | Description                               |
|-----------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------|
| /api/generate         | POST          | Generate a secret code for a new game     |
| /api/evaluate         | POST          | Evaluate a player's guess                 |
| /api/gethint          | GET           | Reveal a hint for the secret code         |
| /api/settings         | GET           | Fetch current game settings               |
| /api/getleaderboard   | GET           | Fetch top 10 scores per difficulty        |

---

## Notes

- The backend must be running for the frontend to function.
- Hints increment the attempt counter, and the game ends automatically when attempts are exhausted.
- You can change VITE_API_URL in .env to point to your deployed backend if needed.
